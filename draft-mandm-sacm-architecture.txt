   (SACM) architecture and begins to explore a potential solution based
   on [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid].  The SACM architecture is predicated
   upon information gleaned from SACM Use Cases and Requirements
   ([RFC7632] and [RFC8248] respectively) and terminology as found in
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

1.  Introduction

   The SACM working group has experienced some difficulty gaining
   consensus around a single architectural vision.  Our hope is that
   this document begins to alleviate this.  We have recognized viability
   in approaches sometimes thought to be at odds with each other -
   specifically [I-D.ietf-sacm-ecp] and [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid].  We
   believe that these approaches complement each other to more
   completely meet the spirit of [RFC7632] and [RFC8248].

   The authors recognize that some state collection mechanisms exist
   today, some do not, and of those that do, some may need to be
   improved.  In other words, we can gain the most advantage by
   supporting a variety of collection mechanisms, including those that
   exist today.  The authors further recognize that SACM ideally intends
   to enable a cooperative ecosystem of tools from disparate sources
   with minimal operator configuration.  The architecture described in
   this document seeks to accommodate these recognitions by first

   defining a generic abstract architecture, then making that
   architecture somewhat more concrete.

1.1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

                      Figure 1: Notional Architecture

   As shown in Figure 1, the notional SACM architecture consists of some
   basic SACM Components using a message transfer system to communicate.
   While not depicted, the message transfer system is expected to

Internet-Draft              SACM Architecture                 March 2018


   maximally align with the requirements described in [RFC8248], which
   means that the message transfer system will support brokered (i.e.
   point-to-point) and proxied data exchange.

   Additionally, component-specific interfaces (i.e. such as A, B, C,
   and D in Figure 1) are expected to be specified logically then bound
   to one or more specific implementations.  This should be done for
   each capability related to the given SACM Component.

3.1.  SACM Roles and Functions

   TBD

3.2.  XMPP-based Solution

   In Figure 2, we have a more detailed view of the architecture - one
   that fosters the development of a pluggable ecosystem of cooperative
   tools.  Existing collection mechanisms (ECP/SWIMA included) can be
   brought into this architecture by specifying the interface of the
   collector and creating the XMPP-Grid Connector.  Additionally, while
   not directly depicted in Figure 2, this architecture does not
   preclude point-to-point interfaces.  In fact,
   [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] provides brokering capabilities to
   facilitate such point-to-point data transfers, though
   [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] does not provide everything SACM needs (an
   update to that draft or a new, extending draft is needed).
   Additionally, each of the SACM Components depicted in Figure 2 may be
   a Provider, a Consumer, or both, depending on the circumstance.

                      Figure 2: Detailed Architecture

   At this point, [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] does not provide enough of a
   start for SACM, and there are other XMPP extensions we need to
   consider to meet the needs of [RFC7632] and [RFC8248].  In Figure 2
   we therefore use "XMPP-Grid+" to indicate something more than
   [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] alone.  Specifically, the authors would
   propose work to extend (or modify) [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] to
   include additional XEPs, possibly the following:

   o  Entity Capabilities (XEP-0115): May be used to express the
      specific capabilities that a particular client embodies.

   o  Form Discovery and Publishing (XEP-0346): May be used for
      datastream examples requiring some expression of a request
      followed by an expected response.

   o  Ad Hoc Commands (XEP-0050): May be usable for simple orchestration
      (i.e. "do assessment").

   o  File Repository and Sharing (XEP-0214): Appears to be needed for
      handling large amounts of data (if not fragmenting).

   o  Publishing Stream Initiation Requests (XEP-0137): Provides ability
      to stream information between two XMPP entities.

   o  PubSub Collection Nodes (XEP-0248): Nested topics for
      specialization to the leaf node level.

   o  Security Labels In Pub/Sub (XEP-0314): Enables tagging data with
      classification categories.

   o  PubSub Chaining (XEP-0253): Federation of publishing nodes
      enabling a publish node of one server to be a subscriber to a
      publishing node of another server

   o  Easy User Onboarding (XEP-401): Simplified client registration

4.  SACM Components, Capabilities, and Interfaces

   As previously mentioned, the SACM Architecture consists of a variety
   of SACM Components, and named components are intended to embody one
   or more specific capabilities.  Interacting with these capabilities
   will require at least two levels of interface specification.  The
   first is a logical interface specification, and the second is at
   least one binding to a specific transfer mechanism, where the
   preferred transfer mechanism would be XMPP-grid.

   The scenarios described in this section are informational, but may be
   taken as guidance or a starting point for further specifications
   concerning each of these areas.

4.1.  Components

   The list of SACM Components is theoretically endless, but we need to
   start somewhere.  The following is a list of suggested SACM Component
   classes and specializations.

   o  Repository

      *  Vulnerability Information Repository

      *  Software Inventory Repository

      *  Configuration Policy Repository

      *  Configuration State Repository

   o  Collector

      *  Software Inventory Collector

      *  Vulnerability State Collector

      *  Configuration State Collector

   o  Evaluator

      *  Software Inventory Evaluator

      *  Vulnerability State Evaluator

      *  Configuration State Evaluator

   o  Orchestrator

      *  Vulnerability Management Orchestrator

      *  Configuration Management Orchestrator

      *  Asset Management Orchestrator

4.1.1.  Policy Services

   Consider a policy server conforming to [I-D.ietf-mile-rolie].
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rolie] describes a RESTful way based on the ATOM
   Publishing Protocol ([RFC5023]) to find specific data collections.
   While this represents a specific binding (i.e.  RESTful API based on
   [RFC5023]), there is a more abstract way to look at ROLIE.

   ROLIE provides notional workspaces and collections, and provides the
   concept of information categories and links.  Strictly speaking,
   these are logical concepts independent of the RESTful binding ROLIE
   specifies.  In other words, ROLIE binds a logical interface (i.e.
   GET workspace, GET collection, SET entry, and so on) to a specific
   mechanism (namely an ATOM Publication Protocol extension).

   It is not inconceivable to believe there could be a different
   interface mechanism, or a connector, providing these same operations
   using XMPP-Grid as the transfer mechanism.

4.1.2.  Software Inventory

   The SACM working group has accepted work on the Endpoint Compliance
   Profile [I-D.ietf-sacm-ecp], which describes a collection
   architecture and may be viewed as a collector coupled with a
   collection-specific repository.

+------+        +--------+      +---------------+        +---------------+


                   Figure 3: ECP Collection Architecture

   In Figure 3, any of the communications between the Posture Manager
   and ECP components to its left could be performed directly or
   indirectly using a given message transfer mechanism.  For example,
   the pub/sub interface between the Orchestrator and the Posture
   Manager could be using a proprietary method or using
   [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] or some other pub/sub mechanism.
   Similarly, the store connection from the Posture Manager to the
   Repository could be performed internally to a given implementation,
   via a RESTful API invocation over HTTPS, or even over a pub/sub
   mechanism.

   Our assertion is that the Evaluator, Repository, Orchestrator, and
   Posture Manager all have the potential to represent SACM Components
   with specific capability interfaces that can be logically specified,
   then bound to one or more specific transfer mechanisms (i.e.  RESTful
   API, [I-D.ietf-mile-rolie], [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid], and so on).

   An equally plausible way to view the ECP collection architecture
   might be as depicted in Figure 4.

   Here, the Posture Manager is the aggregate of Repository, Posture

   connect via a RESTful API, as could an Orchestrator.  Alternatively,
   and as depicted in Figure 5 below, the Posture Manager could interact
   with other security ecosystem components using an XMPP-Grid
   connector.

          Figure 5: Another Alternate ECP Collection Architecture

   There is yet another alternative (see Figure 6 below) that could be
   worth exploring.  What if the connection between an ECP posture
   collection group (Posture Collection and Posture Collection Engine
   together) and the Posture Manager were not done over PA/TNC but
   instead via XMPP?  In such a scenario, the software running on the
   Endpoint would essentially be an posture collector that is an XMPP
   entity participating in the SACM-extended XMPP-grid.

4.1.3.  Datastream Collection

   [NIST800126], also known as SCAP 1.3, provides the technical
   specifications for a "datastream collection".  The specification
   describes the "datastream collection" as being "composed of SCAP data
   streams and SCAP source components".  A "datastream" provides an
   encapsulation of the SCAP source components required to, for example,
   perform configuration assessment on a given endpoint.  These source
   components include XCCDF checklists, OVAL Definitions, and CPE
   Dictionary information.  A single "datastream collection" may
   encapsulate multiple "datastreams", and reference any number of SCAP
   components.  Datastream collections were intended to provide an
   envelope enabling transfer of SCAP data more easily.

   The [NIST800126] specification also defines the "SCAP result data
   stream" as being conformant to the Asset Reporting Format
   specification, defined in [NISTIR7694].  The Asset Reporting Format
   provides an encapsulation of the SCAP source components, Asset
   Information, and SCAP result components, such as system
   characteristics and state evaluation results.

   What [NIST800126]did not do is specify the interface for finding or
   acquiring source datastream information, nor an interface for
   publishing result information.  Discovering the actual resources for
   this information could be done via ROLIE, as described in the Policy
   Services section above, but other repositories of SCAP data exist as
   well.

4.1.4.  Network Configuration Collection

   [draft-birkholz-sacm-yang-content] illustrates a SACM Component
   incorporating a YANG Push client function and an XMPP-grid publisher
   function. [draft-birkholz-sacm-yang-content] further states "the
   output of the YANG Push client function is encapsulated in a SACM
   Content Element envelope, which is again encapsulated in a SACM
   statement envelope" which are published, essentially, via an XMPP-
   Grid Connector for SACM Components also part of the XMPP-Grid.

   This is a specific example of an existing collection mechanism being
   adapted to the XMPP-Grid message transfer system.

4.2.  Capabilities

   Repositories will have a need for fairly standard CRUD operations and
   query by attribute operations.  Collector interfaces may enable ad
   hoc assessment (on-demand processing), state item watch actions (i.e.
   watch a particular item for particular change), persisting other
   behaviors (i.e. setting some mandatory reporting period).  Evaluators
   may have their own set of interfaces, and an Assessor would represent
   both Collector and Evaluation interfaces, and may have additional
   concerns added to an Assessor Interface.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA tables can probably be used to make life a little easier.  We
   would like a place to enumerate:

   o  Capability/operation semantics

   o  SACM Component implementation identifiers

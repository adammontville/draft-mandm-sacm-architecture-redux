   Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) Architecture
                  draft-mandm-sacm-architecture-latest

Abstract

   This memo documents the Security Automation and Continuous Monitoring
   (SACM) architecture to be used by SACM participants when crafting
   SACM-related solutions.  The SACM architecture is predicated upon
   information gleaned from SACM Use Cases and Requirements ([RFC7632]
   and [RFC8248] respectively) and terminology as found in
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

1.  Introduction

   The SACM working group has experienced some difficulty gaining
   consensus around a single architectural vision.  Our hope is that
   this document begins to alleviate this.  We have recognized viability
   in approaches sometimes thought to be at odds with each other -
   specifically [I-D.ietf-sacm-ecp] and [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid].  We
   believe that, in reality, these approaches complement each other to
   more completely meet the spirit of [RFC7632] and [RFC8248].

   The authors recognize that some state collection mechanisms exist
   today, some do not, and of those that do, some may need to be
   improved.  The authors further recognize that SACM ideally intends to
   enable a cooperative ecosystem of tools from disparate sources with
   minimal operator configuration.  The architecture described in this
   document seeks to accommodate these recognitions by first defining a
   generic abstract architecture, then making that architecture somewhat
   more concrete.

                      Figure 1: Notional Architecture

   As shown in Figure 1, the notional SACM architecture consists of some
   basic SACM Components using a message transfer system to communicate.
   While not depicted, the message transfer system is expected to
   maximally align with the requirements described in [RFC8248], which
   means that the message transfer system will support brokered (i.e.
   point-to-point) and proxied data exchange.

   Additionally, component-specific interfaces (i.e. such as A, B, C,
   and D in Figure 1) are expected to be specified logically then bound
   to one or more specific implementations.  This should be done for
   each capability related to the given SACM Component.

                      Figure 2: Detailed Architecture

   In Figure 2, we have a more detailed view of the architecture - one
   that fosters the development of a pluggable ecosystem of cooperative
   tools.  Existing collection mechanisms (ECP/SWIMA included) can be
   brought into this architecture by specifying the interface of the
   collector and creating the XMPP-Grid Connector.  Additionally, while
   not directly depicted in Figure 2, this architecture does not
   preclude point-to-point interfaces.  In fact,
   [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] provides brokering capabilities to
   facilitate such point-to-point data transfers.

   Each of the SACM Components listed depicted in Figure 2 may be a
   Provider, a Consumer, or both, depending on the circumstance.

4.  A Word On SACM Components, Capabilities, and Interfaces

   As previously mentioned, the SACM Architecture consists of a variety
   of SACM Components, and named components are intended to embody one
   or more specific capabilities.  Interacting with these capabilities
   will require at least two levels of interface specification.  The
   first is a logical interface specification, and the second is at

   least one binding to a specific transfer mechanism, where the
   preferred transfer mechanism would be XMPP-grid.

   The scenarios described in this section are informational.

4.1.  Policy Services

   Consider a policy server conforming to [I-D.ietf-mile-rolie].
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rolie] describes a RESTful way based on the ATOM
   Publishing Protocol ([RFC5023]) to find specific data collections.
   While this represents a specific binding (i.e.  RESTful API based on
   [RFC5023]), there is a more abstract way to look at ROLIE.  ROLIE
   provides notional workspaces and collections, and provides the
   concept of information categories and links.  Strictly speaking,
   these are logical concepts independent of the RESTful binding ROLIE
   specifies.  In other words, ROLIE binds a logical interface (i.e.
   GET workspace, GET collection, SET entry, and so on) to a specific
   mechanism (namely an ATOM Publication Protocol extension).  It is not
   inconceivable to believe there could be a different interface
   mechanism, or a connector, providing these same operations using
   XMPP-Grid as the transfer mechanism.

4.2.  Software Inventory

   TODO: Add ECP/SWIMA here.

4.3.  Datastream Collection

   TODO: Add SCAP datastream colleciton here.

4.4.  Network Configuration Collection

   TODO: Add YANG Push here.

5.  Enumerating SACM components

   The list of SACM Components is theoretically endless, but we need to
   start somewhere.  The following is a list of suggested SACM
   Components.

   o  Vulnerability Information Repository

   o  Software Inventory Collector

   o  Software Inventory Repository

   o  Configuration Policy Repository

   o  Configuration State Repository

   o  Vulnerability Management Orchestrator

   o  Configuration Management Orchestrator

6.  Privacy Considerations

7.  Security Considerations

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA tables can probably be used to make life a little easier.  We
   would like a place to enumerate:

   o  Capability/operation semantics

   o  SACM Component implementation identifiers

   o  SACM Component versions

   o  Associations of SACM Components (and versions) to specific
      Capabilities

Appendix A.  Endpoint Compliance Profile as a Collector

   The SACM working group has accepted work on the Endpoint Compliance
   Profile [I-D.ietf-sacm-ecp], which describes a collection
   architecture and may be viewed as a collector coupled with a
   collection-specific repository.

                   Figure 3: ECP Collection Architecture

   In Figure 3, any of the communications between the Posture Manager
   and ECP components to its left could be performed directly or
   indirectly using a given message transfer mechanism.  For example,
   the pub/sub interface between the Orchestrator and the Posture
   Manager could be using a proprietary method or using
   [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid] or some other pub/sub mechanism.  Similar
   the store connection from the Posture Manager to the Repository could
   be performed internally to a given implementation, via a RESTful API
   invocation over HTTPS, or even over a pub/sub mechanism.

   Our assertion is that the Evaluator, Respository, Orchestrator, and
   Posture Manager all have the potential to represent SACM Components
   with specific capability interfaces that can be logically specified,
   then bound to one or more specific mechanisms (i.e.  RESTful API,
   [I-D.ietf-mile-rolie], [I-D.ietf-mile-xmpp-grid], and so on).

   An equally plausible way to view the ECP collection architecture
   might be as depicted in Figure 4.

              Figure 4: Alternate ECP Collection Architecture

   Here, the Posture Manager is the aggregate of Repository, Posture
   Validator, and Posture Collection Manager.  An evaluator could
   connect via a RESTful API, as could an Orchestrator.  Alternatively,
   and as depicted in Figure 5, The Posture Manager could interact with
   other security ecosystem components using an XMPP-Grid connector.
